				<p>
					Hi, I’m Jacob Mosser, a dedicated Game Development student at Full Sail University, proudly maintaining a 4.0 GPA.
					My journey into the world of game development is driven by a passion for creativity and technology, which has also led me to my current role as an IT Support Analyst at Teijin Automotive Technologies.
				<p>
					Hailing from a background of diverse technical skills and problem-solving expertise, I’ve honed my abilities both in academic settings and professional environments.
					At Full Sail University, I’ve immersed myself in learning the intricacies of game design, development, and the technology that powers the gaming industry.
					My academic excellence is a testament to my commitment and love for the field.
				</p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my current role, I previously worked as a Production Superintendent, which has enhanced my leadership capabilities and provided valuable experience in managing teams and operations.
					This blend of technical knowledge and leadership experience uniquely positions me to tackle challenges in the game development industry.
                </p>
                <p>
					When I’m not studying or working, you can find me delving into the latest games, experimenting with new technologies, or exploring the outdoors.
					My experiences as an IT Support Analyst and Production Superintendent have equipped me with the ability to troubleshoot and solve complex problems, skills that are invaluable in game development.
                </p>

                    Feel free to connect with me via email at jlmosser@student.fullsail.edu. I look forward to sharing my journey and collaborating with like-minded enthusiasts!
